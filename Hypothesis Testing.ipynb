    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used in various industries to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. Here are several industry-based examples of hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Pharmaceuticals: Drug Efficacy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** A pharmaceutical company develops a new drug to treat a specific medical condition and wants to determine if the drug is more effective than the existing treatment.\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "- `Null Hypothesis (H0):` The new drug is equally effective as the existing treatment.\n",
    "- `Alternative Hypothesis (H1):` The new drug is more effective than the existing treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test:** A clinical trial is conducted, and statistical tests are performed to analyze the data and determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Finance: Investment Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** A financial analyst proposes a new investment strategy that claims to outperform the current market average.\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The new investment strategy does not outperform the market average.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The new investment strategy outperforms the market average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test:** Historical data is collected and analyzed using statistical tests to assess whether the returns from the proposed strategy are significantly different from the market average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Manufacturing: Production Process Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** A manufacturing plant implements changes to its production process with the goal of reducing defects in the final product.\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The changes to the production process do not reduce defects.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The changes to the production process reduce defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test:** Data on defect rates before and after the changes are collected, and statistical tests are performed to determine if there is a significant improvement.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Formulate the Hypotheses**\n",
    "The first step is to clearly define the null hypothesis (H₀) and the alternative hypothesis (H₁). \n",
    "    - `Null Hypothesis (H₀)`: There is no significant difference between the observed sample and the general population or between two samples.\n",
    "    - `Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)`: There is a significant difference or effect that is not due to chance alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select the Significance Level (α)**\n",
    "The significance level (α) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error). Commonly used α levels are 0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collect and Analyze Data**\n",
    "Data collection can be done through random sampling or experimental design. The data must be relevant to the hypotheses and collected in a way that minimizes bias. Once collected, the data is analyzed to summarize its main characteristics, often through descriptive statistics or visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Test Statistic**\n",
    "The test statistic is a numerical value calculated from the sample data that, under the null hypothesis, follows a known distribution. The choice of test statistic depends on the nature of the data and the hypothesis being tested. Common tests include t-tests, z-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Determine the Critical Region or Calculate the P-value**\n",
    "    - `Critical Region`: This approach involves comparing the test statistic to critical values that define regions where the null hypothesis would be rejected. The critical values are determined based on the significance level and the distribution of the test statistic.\n",
    "    - `P-value`: Alternatively, the p-value approach calculates the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the value calculated from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (α), the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
    "    - **We prefer using the p-value method over the critical-region method.**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Make a Decision**\n",
    "    - If the test statistic falls within the critical region or the p-value is less than or equal to α, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "    - If the test statistic does not fall within the critical region or the p-value is greater than α, do not reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Draw Conclusions**\n",
    "Finally, interpret the results in the context of the original research question or business problem. This involves stating whether the findings support the alternative hypothesis and discussing the implications of the results for the problem at hand."

    "Beyond choosing a hypothesis test, it is important to understand whether the data you have meets the assumptions of the test you want to run. Each hypothesis test has a unique set of assumptions, however, there is one assumption that all hypothesis tests share: the data was randomly sampled from the population of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because random sampling ensures that the sample is representative of the population in terms of observed (and unobserved) characteristics. Unfortunately, there may be situations where random sampling is impossible, but it is important to understand how this can bias results of a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s return to the example with the yogurt company “The Dairy Culture”. Let’s say the company had multiple factories, but the quality assurance team only collected yogurts from one specific factory. The data is thus not randomly sampled from the entire population that we care about (all factories), and could be biased if the quality of yogurt differs at each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "There can also be ethical issues that arise when a sample is not representative of a population. When developing and testing a vaccine, for example, researchers must make sure to find volunteers from an appropriate proportion of genders, races, age ranges, pre-existing conditions, and so on to test efficacy for the entire population that the vaccine will be used on. If the vaccine manufacturers test on a sample that doesn’t include sufficient data for one race, there is a risk that there could be reduced (if during the initial research phase) or unknown efficacy for that group.\n",
